# Adding From Websites

:::important
To request a new extension, or to report an issue with an existing one, please use the
[extensions repository](https://github.com/xgi/houdoku-extensions/issues/new/choose).
:::

Houdoku allows you read manga from aggregator/scanlator websites using extensions. Each extension
adds support for a specific website and is updated independently of Houdoku.

## Install Extensions

Go to the `Extensions` tab on the left side of the client. Search for an extension you want to add,
and click the `Install` button on the right side of the table. When the extension is installed,
you'll see it jump to the top of the list, and a status message will appear at the bottom of the screen.

Extensions are lightweight -- install as many as you want! When an update is available for an
extension, you'll see an `Update` button next to the `Remove` option.

:::tip
Some extensions have their own settings. See the **[Extension Settings](/docs/extensions/extension-settings)** page for more info.

## Adding a Series

To add a series to your library, go to the `Add Series` tab on the left. Select the extension
you want to use from the dropdown at the top, and search for the series you want to add.

Clicking a cover image will display a pop-up modal with the series info retrieved from the extension. 
Click the `Add Series` button at the bottom to add it to your library. Once it's added, the cover
will have a green checkmark in the top-right corner.
