# Adding From Websites

:::info
To request a new extension, or to report an issue with an existing one, please use the
[extensions repository](https://github.com/xgi/houdoku-extensions/issues/new/choose).
:::

Houdoku allows you read manga from aggregator/scanlator websites using extensions. Each extension
adds support for a specific website and is updated independently of Houdoku.

## Install an extension

Go to the <TabText name='extensions'/> tab. Search for an extension you want to add,
and click the `Install` button on the right side of the table. When an update is available for an
extension, you'll see an `Update` button next to the remove icon.

## Add a series

Go to the <TabText name='search'/> tab. Select the extension from the dropdown in the top left,
and search for a series. From the search results, click the cover image of a series you want to add.
A popup will display the series information -- click `Add Series` in the bottom right.

You can view the series you added from the <TabText name='library'/> tab.
