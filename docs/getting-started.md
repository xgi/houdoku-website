# Getting Started

## Installation

Download the latest version of Houdoku for your OS from the [download page](/download).

If you get a warning while installing, see the [Windows SmartScreen Warning page](/docs/known-issues/windows-smartscreen-warning).

## (optional) Install Extensions

If you want to read manga from an aggregator/scanlator website, you'll need to install an extension.

Go to the `Extensions` tab on the left side of the client. Search for an extension you want to add,
and click the `Install` button on the right side of the table. When the extension is installed,
you'll see it jump to the top of the list, and a status message will appear at the bottom of the screen.

Extensions are lightweight -- install as many as you want! When an update is available for an
extension, you'll see an `Update` button next to the `Remove` option.

Some extensions have their own settings. See the **[Extension Settings](asd)** page for more info.

## Adding a Series

To add a series to your library, go to the `Add Series` tab on the left. Select the extension
you want to use from the dropdown at the top, and search for the series you want to add.

Clicking a cover image will display a pop-up modal with the series info retrieved from the extension. 
For filesystem imports, you can (optionally) fill out this information yourself. Click the
`Add Series` button at the bottom to add it to your library.

For more in-depth info, see the **[Adding Local Series](/docs/adding-manga/adding-local-series)** and **[Adding Remote Series](asd)** pages.
