# Trackers

Trackers are 3rd-party websites that let you create a list of the manga you read. Houdoku supports
AniList and MyAnimeList.

## Linking Account

To use a tracker in Houdoku, you first need to link your account. Go to `Settings` -> `Trackers`
and follow the instructions for the tracker you want to link. The heading text will change
to `Logged in as <username>`.

## Matching Series Entries

To sync a series in your library with one on the tracker, you need to match the series
entries. On a series page, click the `Trackers` button, go to the tab for the tracker you want to
use, and select the matching entry from the list provided.

:::tip
You **do not** need to have the series already on your list. It will be automatically created
when you edit values or read a chapter.

After matching the entries, you can edit the status, progress, or score, just like you would do
on the tracker website. When you read a chapter, it will automatically update the progress on
your list. You can disable this feature in `Settings` -> `Trackers` -> `Update Progress Automatically`.
