# Offline Downloading

Houdoku allows you to download chapters so that you can read them when you're offline.

To download chapters for a series, click the `Download` button at the top right of the page for
that series in your library. You can also click the download icon on the right side of the chapter
list.

:::info
You can change your download directory in <TabText name='settings'/> -> `General` -> `Custom Downloads Location`.
:::

When a chapter has been downloaded, the download icon will instead show a checkmark. To
view/manage the download queue, go to the <TabText name='downloads'/> tab.
