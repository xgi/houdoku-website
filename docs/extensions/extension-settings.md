# Extension Settings

Some extensions, such as MangaDex, have their own settings. 

To view settings for an installed extension, go to the `Extensions` tab and find
the installed extension on the list. If the extension has its own settings, there
will be a gear icon in the far right column. Click this gear to open the settings modal.

Extension settings are kept when you update an extension. To ensure you have the latest
settings options, please keep your extensions up-to-date.
