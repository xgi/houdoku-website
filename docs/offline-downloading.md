# Offline Downloading

Houdoku allows you to download chapters so that you can read them when you're offline.

To download chapters for a series, right click a row in that series' chapter table
and select one of the download options. When a chapter has been downloaded, you will
see a checkmark in the "DL" column of the chapter table.

The progress of the current download will be displayed in the status bar at the bottom of the
window. To view/manage the download queue, go to the `Downloads` tab.

From this page, you can pause the active download or clear the download queue. Going to
the `My Downloads` section at the top will display your downloaded chapters across all series,
and allow you to delete them individually.
