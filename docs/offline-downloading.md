# Offline Downloading

Houdoku allows you to download chapters so that you can read them when you're offline.

To download chapters for a series, click the Download button at the top right of the page for
that series in your library. You can also right click a specific chapter in the list
to download. When a chapter has been downloaded, you will see a checkmark in the "DL"
column of the chapter table.

:::tip
You can change your download directory in `Settings` -> `General` -> `Custom Downloads Location`.
:::

The progress of the current download will be displayed in the status bar at the bottom of the
window. To view/manage the download queue, go to the `Downloads` tab.

From this page, you can pause the active download or clear the download queue. Going to
the `My Downloads` section at the top will display your downloaded chapters across all series,
and allow you to delete them individually.
